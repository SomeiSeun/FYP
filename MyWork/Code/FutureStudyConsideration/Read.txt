So this project is insane innit, good luck future suffering Y4 student, i believe in u <3

Anyways for future considerations you should implement active attitude control systems (LCD panels like on IKAROS or thrusters?)
Also to do this you are gonna need a bigger CubeSat specification!
I suggest you to consider using a 12U CubeSat for its base being 40x40 (good for implmenting and fitting a circular spool).
The current system sizing leads to about 3.99 kg of mass, and adding active attitude control to ADCS shouldn't drastically increase the mass or change power requirements much.
Using a crude approximation of increased mass by 2 kg, you can see from my mass sensitivity study this is still well within the project objective of 100 years to escape. 
Though might be of concern with the power system lifetime. BUT CONSIDER THIS!
The last saved data in my HubSizing code is assuming a 12U cubesat with approximate dimensions and it shows for the original sail size of 454 m^2, it fits with > 20 cm of free space. You could potentially implement an even larger sail within a 12U cubesat for very little mass increase! You will need to do a new design envelope sizing again. Also need to consider the deployment dynamics at a future stage.



P.S. Change the SPAD file based on sail size ;) (SPAD generator is in Filippos' code)
